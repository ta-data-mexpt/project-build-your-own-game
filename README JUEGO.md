## Project Description
The game consists in a pyramid of flipped cards (the back of the card is seen). 'X' amount of cards is also deal to the players. In order, each player will flip 1 card from the pyramid (ex: player 1 first, then player 2), and those who have the flipped card in their deal cards, drink from their glass for 5 seconds.

We choose this proyect, beacuse we considerer that is fun and original.
